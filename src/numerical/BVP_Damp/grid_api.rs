//! # Adaptive Grid Refinement API
//!
//! ## Module Purpose
//! This module provides a unified interface for various adaptive grid refinement algorithms
//! used in boundary value problem (BVP) solvers. It acts as a dispatcher that selects and
//! executes the appropriate grid refinement method based on solution characteristics and
//! user preferences.
//!
//! ## Key Features
//! - **Unified Interface**: Single entry point for all grid refinement algorithms
//! - **Multiple Algorithms**: Supports 6 different refinement strategies from simple to sophisticated
//! - **Automatic Selection**: Chooses optimal refinement based on problem characteristics
//! - **Solution Interpolation**: Provides initial guess on refined mesh through interpolation
//!
//! ## Main Structures
//! - [`GridRefinementMethod`]: Enum defining available refinement algorithms with their parameters
//!
//! ## Core Function
//! - [`new_grid`]: Main dispatcher function that creates refined mesh and interpolated solution
//!
//! ## Available Algorithms
//! 1. **DoublePoints**: Naive approach - doubles mesh density everywhere
//! 2. **Easy**: Simple gradient-based refinement with tolerance parameter
//! 3. **Pearson**: Classical boundary layer algorithm with smoothing
//! 4. **GrcarSmooke**: Advanced method considering both solution and derivative jumps
//! 5. **Sci**: SciPy-inspired residual-based refinement
//! 6. **TwoPoint**: FORTRAN TWOPNT-inspired algorithm with multiple criteria
//!
//! ## Algorithm Selection Guidelines
//! - Use `DoublePoints` for testing or when other methods fail
//! - Use `Easy` for simple problems with moderate gradients
//! - Use `Pearson` for boundary layer problems
//! - Use `GrcarSmooke` for combustion/reaction problems
//! - Use `Sci` when residual information is available
//! - Use `TwoPoint` for complex multi-scale problems
//!
//! ## Integration with BVP Solver
//! This module is called by the damped Newton-Raphson solver when:
//! - Newton iterations fail to converge on current mesh
//! - Solution gradients exceed specified thresholds
//! - Adaptive refinement is enabled in solver configuration

    /// # Parameters
    /// - `f64`: Relative tolerance (typically 0.1 to 0.5)

/// Creates a refined mesh using the specified refinement algorithm
///
/// This is the main entry point for adaptive grid refinement. It analyzes the current
/// solution and mesh, then applies the chosen refinement algorithm to create a finer
/// mesh where needed.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `method` - The grid refinement algorithm to use
/// * `y_DMatrix` - Current solution matrix (variables Ã— mesh points)
/// * `x_mesh` - Current mesh points (spatial/temporal coordinates)
/// * `abs_tolerance` - Absolute tolerance for convergence checking
/// * `residuals` - Optional residual vector (required for Sci method)
///
/// # Returns
/// A tuple containing:
/// * `Vec<f64>` - New refined mesh points
/// * `DMatrix<f64>` - Interpolated solution on new mesh (initial guess)
/// * `usize` - Number of intervals that were refined
///
/// # Algorithm Selection
/// The function dispatches to the appropriate refinement algorithm based on the
/// `method` parameter. Each algorithm analyzes the solution differently:
/// 
/// - **Gradient-based** (Easy, Pearson, GrcarSmooke): Look at solution changes
/// - **Residual-based** (Sci): Uses equation residuals to guide refinement
/// - **Uniform** (DoublePoints): Refines everywhere regardless of solution
/// - **Multi-criteria** (TwoPoint): Combines multiple refinement indicators
///
/// # Interpolation Strategy
/// All methods provide linear interpolation of the old solution onto the new mesh
/// to create an initial guess for the next Newton iteration. This ensures the
/// refined solution starts close to the converged coarse solution.
///
/// # Performance Notes
/// - Refinement cost scales with number of mesh points and solution complexity
/// - Methods that add fewer points (Easy, Pearson) are faster but may need more iterations
/// - Uniform refinement (DoublePoints) is expensive but guaranteed to improve resolution
